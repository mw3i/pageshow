<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: i made this tool for my own courses; use at your own risk. there are things that could be made safer / more user friendly, but this works for my purposes so that’s how it is</p>
<p>Turn a markdown document into a series of html pages (using <a href="https://pandoc.org">pandoc</a>) that you can navigate through like a slide show, like the markdown-to-slideshow tools that are out there (<a href="https://github.com/Muffo/remarkable">Remarkable</a>, <a href="https://marp.app">Marp</a>, etc)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>^ except there’s explicitly no slide formatting. no rules about making everything the same sized block. if a “slide” is too big, you just scroll down during the presentation</p>
<ul>
<li>^ this isn’t how normal slideshows work, but that’s the point. if you want to make a standard slide show you should use those tools</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Motivation</strong>: markdown is amazing, but trying to format slides using plaintext markdown <em>SUCKS</em>; but i like plaintext too much to give it up. the main reason it sucks comes from trying to correctly format everything into a uniformly sized rectangle &lt;– with this tool you don’t have to</p>
<ul>
<li>the inspiration for this came from my advisor, who teaches a cognition course using a word doc instead of a slide show. this tool is meant to be a happy medium between slides and documents</li>
</ul>
<p>I got the sweet latex styling from <a href="https://github.com/davidrzs">David Zollikofer</a>’s <a href="https://github.com/davidrzs/latexcss">latex.css</a></p>
